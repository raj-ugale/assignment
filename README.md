## Medical Treatment Landing Page

### Overview

This project is a responsive medical treatment landing page developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is based on a real healthcare website layout and focuses on accurate UI structure, alignment, and section-wise organization rather than visual effects alone.

The project demonstrates my ability to convert a design reference into a structured, maintainable front-end implementation.
